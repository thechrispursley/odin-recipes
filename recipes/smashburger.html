    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Create a restaurant style Smash Burger at home in minutes and for a lot less money. You are going to love the crispy brown crust that forms as the burger cooks so quickly.</p>
        
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 soft hamburger roll, buttered and toasted</li> 
            <li>Condiments and toppings as desired, such as mayonnaise, mustard, shredded lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and pickles</li> <li>4 ounces (110g) freshly ground beef chuck, divided into two 2-ounce (55g) balls</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li><li>2 slices good melting cheese, such as American, cheddar, or homemade melting cheese</li>
    <h2>Steps</h2>  
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare burger bun by laying toppings on bottom half of bun. Have it nearby and ready for when your burger is cooked.</li>
        <li>Preheat a large stainless steel saut√© pan or skillet over high heat for 2 minutes. Place balls of beef in pan and smash down with a stiff metal spatula, using a second spatula to add pressure. Smashed patties should be slightly wider than burger bun.</li>
        <li>Season generously with salt and pepper and allow to cook until patties are well browned and tops are beginning to turn pale pink/gray in spots, about 45 seconds. Using a bench scraper or the back side of a stiff metal spatula, carefully scrape patties from pan, making sure to get all of the browned bits.</li>
        <li>Flip patties and immediately place a slice of cheese over both patties then stack the second directly on top. Immediately remove from pan and transfer to waiting burger bun. Serve.</li>
    </ol>
