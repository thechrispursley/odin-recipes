    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The only filet mignon recipe you will ever need. Never grill steak again—the fail-proof method to cooking the perfect filet mignon.</p>
        
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 10-ounce thick tenderloin beef filets (roughly 1.5 – 2 inches thick)</li> 
            <li>coarse kosher salt and pepper to taste</li> <li>vegetable or canola oil</li>
            <li>1/2 stick of butter</li><li>fresh rosemary</li><li>fresh tarragon</li><li>5-6 cloves of garlic</li></ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>  
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 415°F. Remove the steak from the fridge 30 minutes prior to cooking, this is to bring the steak to room temperature and ensure your cooking times are more accurate. Season all sides liberally with salt and pepper. This can be done while your steak comes to room temp.</li>
        <li>Add 1-2 tablespoons of oil to an oven-safe cast iron skillet and turn the heat up high, allowing the skillet to become very hot. Twirl the pan to distribute oil as it heats. Once the oil starts to smoke, place the filets face down and sear undisturbed for 2 minutes. Flip the filets and sear for an additional 2 minutes. This will give your filets a nice seared edge.</li>
        <li>Add butter, garlic and herbs to skillet. Transfer your skillet directly to the oven. <strong>[WARNING] skillet may be hot, handle it with oven mitts.</strong> For rare, bake for 4 minutes. Medium rare, 5-6 minutes. Medium, 6-7 minutes. Medium well, 8-9 minutes. <em>Remember, depending on the size of the steak, the more or less time it will take. This recipe is ideal for an 8-10 ounce portion, roughly 1.5-2 inches thick.</em></li>
        <li>Allow steaks to rest for five minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
